# Shark-Tank-EDA
This Repository addresses one of my favorite TV Shows - Shark Tank. I have collected this data set from online sources and developed a detailed EDA using SQL and generating visualizations using Python, and Power BI. 

I have also answered the below mentioend questions using SQL and then use the generated data to plot graphs using Python, and Power BI - 
  1. Select all columns from the 'Shark Tank' table
  2. Count the number of pitches per industry
  3. Count the number of deals per industry where 'Deal' column is 'Yes'
  4. Calculate the conversion rate (percentage of deals) per industry
  5. Count the number of pitches and deals by entrepreneur gender
  6. Calculate the conversion rate (percentage of deals) by entrepreneur gender
  7. Count the number of deals made by each shark
  8. Show the total equity offered and given up per industry, and the times equity liquidated
  
 Also, Performed the below mentioned Statistical Test using R, to find out more information about the relations among different features. 

  1. Chi-square test of independence: This test can be used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables, such as Entrepreneur                                         Gender and Deal. The test can help to answer questions such as whether there is a relationship between the gender of the                                                 entrepreneur and the likelihood of a deal being made.
  2. T-test or ANOVA: These tests can be used to compare means of continuous variables across different groups. For example, one can test whether there is a significant                        difference in the equity offered or equity given up by industry type, or whether there is a significant difference in the equity liquidation rate                        between different groups of sharks.
  3. Regression analysis: Regression analysis can be used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. For example, one                           can investigate the relationship between the equity offered, equity given up, or equity liquidation rate, and the success of the deal.
